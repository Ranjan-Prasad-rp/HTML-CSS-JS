        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Iron Man is one of the most iconic superheroes in the Marvel Universe, known not only for his advanced suit
            of armor but also for the man behind the mask — Tony Stark. Created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Don Heck, and
            Jack Kirby, Iron Man first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963. Tony Stark is a billionaire
            industrialist, genius inventor, and owner of Stark Industries, a leading weapons manufacturing company. With
            his sharp intellect and charisma, Stark lives a lavish, high-profile life, often portrayed as a brilliant
            but arrogant playboy.

            Iron Man’s origin begins when Stark is injured and captured by terrorists during a weapons demonstration. A
            piece of shrapnel becomes lodged near his heart, threatening his life. While in captivity, with the help of
            a fellow prisoner, Dr. Yinsen, he constructs a crude suit of powered armor to keep himself alive and escape
            his captors. This prototype suit lays the foundation for what becomes the iconic Iron Man armor.

            Upon returning home, Stark undergoes a transformation in mindset. He shuts down the weapons division of his
            company and dedicates his life to using technology for good. He refines his suit into a highly sophisticated
            piece of technology, complete with flight capabilities, repulsor blasts, and AI integration. Unlike many
            superheroes, Tony Stark does not hide behind a secret identity; he publicly declares, “I am Iron Man.”

            Iron Man plays a central role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), portrayed by actor Robert Downey Jr.,
            becoming a founding member of the Avengers and a symbol of courage, sacrifice, and innovation. His journey
            from a self-centered arms dealer to a heroic figure who sacrifices himself for humanity defines his legacy.
            Iron Man isn’t just a man in a suit — he’s a symbol of how intelligence, responsibility, and heart can
            change the world.

        <h1> How He Became ? </h1>
        <p>Tony Stark, a brilliant billionaire industrialist and genius inventor, became Iron Man after a life-altering
            experience in Afghanistan. Initially, Stark was a carefree weapons manufacturer, running Stark Industries —
            a company known for producing advanced military technology. During a demonstration of his latest missile
            system, Stark was ambushed and kidnapped by a terrorist group known as the Ten Rings.

            In captivity, Stark was critically injured by shrapnel lodged near his heart. A fellow prisoner, Dr. Ho
            Yinsen, saved his life by constructing an electromagnet powered by a car battery to prevent the shrapnel
            from reaching his heart. The terrorists demanded that Stark build them a missile, but instead, with Yinsen’s
            help, he secretly constructed a powerful suit of armor equipped with weapons and powered by a miniaturized
            arc reactor — a clean energy source he invented.

            The armor allowed Stark to escape, but Yinsen sacrificed himself during the breakout. Deeply affected by the
            experience, Stark returned to the U.S. with a changed outlook on life. He shut down his company's weapons
            division and began refining the suit, transforming it into a highly advanced, weaponized exoskeleton.

            Now calling himself Iron Man, Stark used the suit to protect civilians, fight terrorism, and eventually join
            the superhero team known as the Avengers. The identity of Iron Man became public, and Stark used his persona
            to influence global peace while continuing to improve the technology behind the suit.

            Tony Stark’s transformation into Iron Man wasn't just physical — it marked a major shift in his values. From
            a self-centered weapons dealer, he evolved into a self-sacrificing hero, using his intellect and resources
            to protect humanity rather than profit from it. His journey is a story of redemption, legacy, and
            responsibility.</p>
